## Introduction
- Now that we have seen the basics of an Express server, including our controllers, and additional ways of finding our content, lets get one more practice lab in before we begin working with the Mongoose library tomorrow

## Set Up

- Create a new Express App with routes for no less than 3 travel destination types : Beach, Mountain, Camping, Amusement Park, Historical, Foodie, Eco-Tourism, etc etc etc
- Populate each of these destination types with at least 4 locations. These locations should have properties of their name, location, ratings, cost of admission, and any number of boolean values (open sundays, kid friendly...) and anything else you can think of!
- Create index and show routes for each of these destinations within a Controllers file

## Exercise / User Stories

We can now show index and details of our data points by their Id. For this lab, pick any of these to try to accomplish:

- As a User (AAU) I want a route that will show the details of a destination by its Name
- AAU I want a route that will show all of the destinations in a respective area (France, Italy, New York, Japan, Tom's House, whatever you want to do!)
- AAU I want aroute that shows a number of destination in either increasing, or decreasing price
- AAU I want a route that uses two queries and filters destinations by a Max and Min price for cost of admission
- AAU I want a route that renders only destinations with reviews higher than 4 stars
- AAU I want a route that only has Kid Friendly destinations... but maybe you don't, so make both!

## Bonus
- Create more data! Create more routes! Create more filters! Challenge yourself, and impress us!
- Attach an HTML/CSS/JS front end and use any DOM manipulation to pull up this data!
